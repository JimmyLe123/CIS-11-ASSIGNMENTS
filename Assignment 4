4.2.8 Section Review:
Question 1: Write an instruction that increments val2.

Question 2: Write an instruction that subtracts val3 from EAX.

Question 3: Write instructions that subtract val4 from val2.

Question 4: If val2 is incremented by 1 using the ADD instruction, what will be the values of the Carry
and Sign flags?

Question 5: If val4 is incremented by 1 using the ADD instruction, what will be the values of the Overflow
and Sign flags?

Question 6: Where indicated, write down the values of the Carry, Sign, Zero, and Overflow flags after
each instruction has executed:
mov ax,7FF0h
add al,10h ; a) CF = SF = ZF = OF =
add ah,1 ; b) CF = SF = ZF = OF =
add ax,2 ; c) CF = SF = ZF = OF =
