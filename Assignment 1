1.1.3 Section Review:
Question 1: Assemblers essentially converts the source code that has been entered from assembly 
language into machine language. A linker is something that takes the files that have been 
already converted from the assembler and combines all of them into a single executable code to output.

Question 3: One-to-many relationships between high level language and machine language is that for one line of code from 
high level language can be translated to many instructions or actions that the machine language can interpret.

Question 8: I personally think that type checking would be have more restrictions on high level languages. I think it is more
strict because there could be errors in that code where programmers 
would have trouble identifying where the problem originated from.

Question 12: C++ Expresstion: X = (Y * 4) + 3
Assembly language would have to do the operation in parentheses first, so first, the program would move Y spaces and then add by 4 
because the data prioritizes Y + 4 first. Second, assembly language would move 3 spaces to a separate data storage and then
would add three to the result of (Y * 4). After evaluating, X would then be defined and move to that 
many spaces to the first data storage.

1.2.1 Section Review:
Question 2: I suppose that translate programs run and execute quicker than interpreted ones because since it the program
has already been broken down into simpler terms, it would require less work to run and execute the entire program.

Question 3:"(True/False): When an interpreted program written in language L1 runs, each of its instructions
is decoded and executed by a program written in language L0."
This statement is true because if language L1 is the new language after L0, when L1 runs, its code will be interpreted, decoded 
and then executed by the L0 language.

Question 10: "Statements at the assembly language level of a virtual machine are translated into statements
at which other level?"
These statements from assembly are translated into statements at the Instruction Set Architecture level 
because the program from assembly level needs to be read from the ISA level and then down to the machine language level to 
be fully executed.

1.3.9 Section Review: 
Question 2: "What is the decimal representation of each of the following unsigned binary integers?"
a) 11111000 = 248
b) 11001010 = 204
c) 11110000 = 240

Question 3: "What is the sum of each pair of binary integers?"
a) 00001111 + 00000010 = 00010001
b) 11010101 + 01101011 = 101000000
c) 00001111 + 00001111 = 00011110

Question 5: "What is the minimum number of binary bits needed to represent each of the following
unsigned decimal integers?"
a) 65 = 1000001, so you need at least 7 bits
b) 409 = 100110011, so you need at least 9 bits.
c) 16385 = 100000000000001, so you need at least 15 bits.

Question 6: What is the hexadecimal representation of each of the following binary numbers?
a) 0011 0101 1101 1010 = 35DA
b) 1100 1110 1010 0011 = CEA3
c) 1111 1110 1101 1011 = FEDB

Question 7: What is the binary representation of the following hexadecimal numbers?
a. A4693FBC = 1010 0100 0110 1001 0011 1111 1011 1100
b. B697C7A1 = 1011 0110 1001 0111 1100 0111 1010 0001
c. 2B3D9461 = 0010 1011 0011 1101 1001 0100 0110 0001
