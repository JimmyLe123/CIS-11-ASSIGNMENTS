Question 1: Briefly describe the concept of "Stack Frame" (1 through 5 points depending on quality of the answer)
A stack frame is a collection of data that is associated with the current subroutine that the program is on. The collection
can include the return address, local variables that the subroutine may have, arguments passed, etc.

Question 2: Briefly describe the concept of a "Calling Convention" (1 through 5 points depending on quality of the answer)

Question 3: Why do the book examples always start functions with "push ebp" and "mov ebp,esp" (2 points)

Question 4: What is the x64 equivalent to "push epb" and "mov ebp,esp)" (2 points)

Question 5: What are the differences between "Microsoft x64 calling convention" and "System V AMD64 ABI calling convention?" 
(2 points)

For Questions 6 and 7, reference
void myFunction(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f)  
{
  //some code here
}

Question 6: Upon entry to myFunction (above), what does the stack look like when using Microsoft x64 calling convention? (3 points)

Question 7: Upon entry to myFunction (above), what does the stack look like when using stdcall convention (3 points)
