Question 1: Which assignment took you the longest to complete?
I think the assignment that took the longest was assignment 7 with the boolean calculator.
 
Question 2: Which assignment was the most difficult?
In my opinion, the most difficult assignment was assignment 7.
 
Question 3: Which assignment was the easiest?
I thought that the easiest assignment was assignment 8 where we had to convert binary to decimal using the code given.
 
Question 4: Of the concepts we covered, which (if any) are you the most confused about still?
Personally, I felt that I am not confused with anything that we have covered because it pretty much is remembering the syntax
for the operations.
 
Question 5: If we had an extra week to spend on any of the concepts covered in this course, which one would it be?
If we had another week to cover a concept, I would want it to be both the push and pop instructions because I felt that
we have not covered it in depth to know how to use it.

Question 6: Were there any assignments you felt were unnecessarily tedious (not necessarily difficult, but that took too long to complete)
I would say that the last two assignments (12 and 13) felt tedious because they involved rotating numbers to get into the
correct position and that takes time becausey you have to reset the loop counter again.

Question 7: Which assignment was your favorite?
My favorite assignment would have to be assignment 6. I personally had fun playing around with the random generator and changing
colors of the numbers and letter, and I also enjoyed the Fibonacci sequence with the assignment. 

Question 8: Which assignment do you think you learned the most from?


Question 9: Were the assignment requirements and due dates clear enough? If not, how so?


Question 10: On a scale of 1-5, rate the difficulty (1=Breating, 5=Exiting Vim) of this course compared to other CIS courses you've taken.


Question 11: Was the book used in this course effective/helpful? Would you recommend a different one?


Question 12: Were there any topics that we didn't cover that you would have liked to see included?


Question 13: How can this course be improved?
