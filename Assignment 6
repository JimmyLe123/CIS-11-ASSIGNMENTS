5.9 Programming Exercises: 
Question 7: Write a program that displays a single character at 100 random screen locations, using a timing
delay of 100 milliseconds. Hint: Use the GetMaxXY procedure to determine the current size of
the console window.

main proc
	XOR rdx,rdx
	call Random64
	mov rcx, 100
	div rcx
	mov rcx,rdx
L1: 
	mov rax, rcx
	call WriteInt64
	call ReadInt64
	call WriteInt64
	Loop L1
main endp

end


Question 10: Write a procedure that produces N values in the Fibonacci number series and stores them in an
array of doubleword. Input parameters should be a pointer to an array of doubleword, a
counter of the number of values to generate. Write a test program that calls your procedure,
passing N = 47. The first value in the array will be 1, and the last value will be 2,971,215,073.
Use the Visual Studio debugger to open and inspect the array contents.
