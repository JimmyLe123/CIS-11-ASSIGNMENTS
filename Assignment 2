2.1.5 Section Review:
Question 1: The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?
The four components that the CPU has are registers, the Control Unit(CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU), and the clock.

Question 2: The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three
buses? The CPU connects the system using three buses to connect information, the data bus, the control bus, and the address bus.

Question 3: Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access? Memory access takes more cycles than register
because the computer requires to read and write the memory since it is not a part of the CPU unlike registers that are 
implemented into the CPU.

Question 4: What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle? The instruction execution style can all be 
simplified into three steps: 1) Fetch, 2) Decode, and 3) Execute.

Question 5: Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory
operand is used? Whenever memory operands are involved, the instruction execution cycle include two more steps which are:
1) Fecth the operands, and 2) Store the result.

2.2.4 Section Review:
Question 1: What are the x86 processorâ€™s three basic modes of operation? The three basic modes of operation of the x86 
processor are 1) Protected mode, 2) Real-address mode, and 3) Private 8086 mode.

Question 2:  Name all eight 32-bit general-purpose registers. The eight 32-bit general-purpose registers are: 1) EAX, 2) EBX,
3) ECX, 4) EDX, 5) EBP, 6) ESP, 7) ESI, and 8) EDI.

Question 3: Name all six segment registers. All six of the 16-bit segment registers are: 1) CS, 2) SS, 3) DS, 4) ES 5) FS, 6) GS

Question 4: What special purpose does the ECX register serve? The ECX registers serves as a loop counter when the 
CPU automatically access it.

2.4.3 Section Review: 
Question 1: Describe SRAM and its most common use.

Question 2: Describe VRAM

Question 3: List at least two features found in the Intel P965 Express chipset

Question 4: Name four types of RAM mentioned in this chapter.

Question 5: What is the purpose of the 8259A PIC controller?
