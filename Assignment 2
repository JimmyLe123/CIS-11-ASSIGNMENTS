2.1.5 Section Review:
Question 1: The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?
The four components that the CPU has are registers, the Control Unit(CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU), and the clock.

Question 2: The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three
buses? The CPU connects the system using three buses to connect information, the data bus, the control bus, and the address bus.

Question 3: Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access? Memory access takes more cycles than register
because the computer requires to read and write the memory since it is not a part of the CPU unlike registers that are 
implemented into the CPU.

Question 4: What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle? The instruction execution style can all be 
simplified into three steps: 1) Fetch, 2) Decode, and 3) Execute.

Question 5: Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory
operand is used? Whenever memory operands are involved, the instruction execution cycle include two more steps which are:
1) Fecth the operands, and 2) Store the result.

2.4.3 Section Review: 
Question 1: Describe SRAM and its most common use. SRAM(also known as Static Random Access Memory) is mainly used for the CPU 
cache memory where it does not have to be refreshed because it is high speed cache memory.

Question 2: Describe VRAM. VRAM(also known as Video Random Access Memory) is mainly used for video data. The most knoen function
for VRAM is beinf able to multitask between refreshing what the computer may be displaying and writing data to show what to 
display.

Question 3: List at least two features found in the Intel P965 Express chipset: 1) Support for many USB ports, supports multiple
PCI express slots, networking, and Intel Quiet System technology. 2) I/O Controller Hub (Intel ICH8/R/DH) uses 
Intel Matrix Storage Technology (MST) to support multiple Serial ATA devices (disk drives).

Question 4: Name four types of RAM mentioned in this chapter. The four types of RAM that are mentioned in this section are:
1) VRAM(Video RAM), 2) SRAM(Static RAM), 3) DRAM(Dynamic Ram), and 4) CMOS RAM(Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor RAM)

Question 5: What is the purpose of the 8259A PIC controller? The 8259A PIC controller has the job of handling external 
interrupts from any hardware device, such as disk drives, clock drives, and keyboards. The devices are able to interrupt the
CPU so that it can process their requests as soon as possible.
