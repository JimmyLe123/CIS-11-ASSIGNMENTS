2.1.5 Section Review:
Question 1: The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?
The four components that the CPU has are registers, the Control Unit(CU), the Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU), and the clock.

Question 2: The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three
buses? The CPU connects the system using three buses to connect information, the data bus, the control bus, and the address bus.

Question 3: Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access? Memory access takes more cycles than register
because the computer requires to read and write the memory since it is not a part of the CPU unlike registers that are 
implemented into the CPU.

Question 4: What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle? The instruction execution style can all be 
simplified into three steps: 1) Fetch, 2) Decode, and 3) Execute.

Question 5: Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory
operand is used? Whenever memory operands are involved, the instruction execution cycle include two more steps which are:
1) Fecth the operands, and 2) Store the result.
